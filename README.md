# Unofficial Zed Editor Windows Builds (Automated) 🚀

[![Build status](https://github.com/ssnay/zed-windows-builds-stable/actions/workflows/build-zed-windows.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ssnay/zed-windows-builds-stable/actions/workflows/build-zed-windows.yml)

This repository provides automated, unofficial builds of the [Zed code editor](https://zed.dev/) for Windows.

**Disclaimer:** Zed does not yet officially release builds for Windows. These builds are provided for testing and convenience only. They are compiled directly from the official Zed source code corresponding to their stable release tags but are **not** officially supported by Zed Industries.

## Unofficial Zed Editor Builds for Windows

Get the latest unofficial Windows build from the **[Releases Page](https://github.com/Satya-Siba-Nayak/zed-windows-builds-stable/releases)** of this repository!

### Quick Start

1. 📥 Go to the [Releases Page](https://github.com/Satya-Siba-Nayak/zed-windows-builds-stable/releases).
2. 🔽 Download the `.zip` file attached to the latest release (e.g., `zed-windows-vX.Y.Z.zip`).
3. 📁 Extract the contents of the `.zip` file to a folder of your choice.
4. 👉 Run the `zed.exe` executable directly. No installation required! 🚀

## Build Workflow

This repository uses a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/build-zed-windows-auto.yml`) that automatically:
1. ⏰ Checks the official [zed-industries/zed repository](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed) for the latest stable release tag on a schedule.
2. 👀 If a new stable release is found, it checks out the corresponding source code.
3. 💻 Builds the Zed editor for Windows using the official source code.
4. 📦 Packages the resulting `zed.exe` into a `.zip` archive.
5. 📦 Creates a new release on *this* repository, tagged with the official Zed version, and uploads the `.zip` file as a downloadable asset.
