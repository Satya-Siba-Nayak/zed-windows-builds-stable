## Licensing

**IMPORTANT:** Zed is dual-licensed. The core editor components are generally licensed under the **Apache License 2.0**, while server-side and collaborative components are licensed under the **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPLv3)**.

*   This binary distribution includes copies of **all relevant license files** (`LICENSE-APACHE`, `LICENSE-AGPL`, etc.) from the source repository.

## Known Issues / Limitations

*   **Unofficial:** This build does not receive official support. Report issues to the repository where you downloaded this build, not the official Zed issue tracker, unless you can reproduce the issue with an official build (when available) or confirm it's an upstream bug.
*   **Stability:** May be less stable than official releases (when they become available).
*   **Collaborative Features:** Due to the AGPL license on server components, collaborative features might not work correctly unless you have set up the required backend dependencies (Postgres, LiveKit) locally. This build likely does *not* bundle these dependencies, and using Zed's official collaboration servers might have implications under the AGPL.
*   **Updates:** You will need to manually download newer unofficial builds or wait for official releases; this build will not auto-update.
