# Unofficial Zed Editor Windows Builds (Automated)

[![Build Status](https://github.com/Satya-Siba-Nayak/zed-windows-builds-stable/actions/workflows/build-zed-windows-auto.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Satya-Siba-Nayak/zed-windows-builds-stable/actions/workflows/build-zed-windows-auto.yml)

This repository provides automated, unofficial builds of the [Zed code editor](https://zed.dev/) for Windows.

**Disclaimer:** Zed does not yet officially release builds for Windows. These builds are provided for testing and convenience only. They are compiled directly from the official Zed source code corresponding to their stable release tags but are **not** officially supported by Zed Industries.

## How it Works

This repository uses a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/build-zed-windows-auto.yml`) that automatically:
1.  Checks the official [zed-industries/zed repository](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed) for the latest stable release tag on a schedule.
2.  If a new stable release is found, it checks out the corresponding source code.
3.  Builds the Zed editor for Windows using the official source code.
4.  Packages the resulting `zed.exe` into a `.zip` archive.
5.  Creates a new release on *this* repository, tagged with the official Zed version, and uploads the `.zip` file as a downloadable asset.

## Downloads

You can download the latest unofficial Windows build from the **[Releases Page](https://github.com/Satya-Siba-Nayak/zed-windows-builds-stable/releases)** of this repository.

**Installation:**
1.  Go to the [Releases Page](https://github.com/Satya-Siba-Nayak/zed-windows-builds-stable/releases).
2.  Download the `.zip` file attached to the latest release (e.g., `zed-windows-vX.Y.Z.zip`).
3.  Extract the contents of the `.zip` file to a folder of your choice.
4.  Run the `zed.exe` executable directly. No installation required!
